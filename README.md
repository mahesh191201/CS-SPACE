# CS Space

CS SPACE is an unofficial academic portal for CS undergrads of GIET. Here students can find the much needed exam papers, study material require to pull the night before the exam. Our motive is to provide every material you need throughout 4 years at one place and reduce the burden on faculty. 

# Overview

The ultimate aim of this project was to solve the availability of question papers and study materials for students as well as for faculty. Many students feel nervous at the time of semester exams when they are unable to find the proper material to sail through. Keeping this problem in our view we came up with this project.
